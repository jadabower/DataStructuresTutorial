## About This Tutorial

This project will be a tutorial to learn and use a few commonly used Data Structures.

A Data Structure is a formatted way of organizing information, specifically in code. There are many different kinds of
Data Structures because each one has it's own strengths and weaknesses.

We represent a Data Structures' efficiency (how fast it is at doing a specific task, in other words, the strengths and
weaknesses of the structure) by using the "Big O" notation. Big O works just like a function in math: there is an
input (n), and an output (time). So if I were to say the performance of a function is O(n^2), that would mean the time
it takes to complete the task is roughly squared the input size. So a function with O(n) input is faster than one with
O(n^2).

This tutorial is in the C# language, so any syntactical questions may be referred to
the [C# documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).
