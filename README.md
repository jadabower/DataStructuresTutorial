# Overview

For this project, I decided to create a Markdown tutorial to teach 3 different data
structures in C#. I decided to teach Stacks, Linked Lists, and Binary Search Trees. 

I wanted to do this because I believe that you can't really understand something
unless you can teach it to someone else. So, I thought if I could create a tutorial that
was well thought-out and included some excellent explanations and examples of each data
structure, I would get a much better grasp of those data structures myself.

My program consists of several Markdown files with the information on the data
structures, as well as 3 C# Projects for each structure as some examples and problems
for the user to look at and solve themselves.

# Future Work

- More pictures
- Better explanations for how some hard concepts work (like recursion)
